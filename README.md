## Introduction

This projects shows a working example of mutation testing in java and javascript.


## Building Requirements

### For Java

* mvn 3
* java 8

### For JavaScript

* node v4
* mocha
* istanbul

## Commands to build

### For Java

       ./run-mutation-tests

* Then navigate to reports in the target dir

### For JavaScript

      ./run-mocha

* Then navigate to reports in reports or coverage directories respectively. 
* Note that I was trying 
      * Both blanket and  istanbul to get the coverage reports. 
      * Grunt mutation testing for mutation reports. 

Therefore you might find multiple reports containing the same information.
